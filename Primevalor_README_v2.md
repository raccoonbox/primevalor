**Primevalor**

"Step into Primevalor, where your greatest quest isn't slaying dragons—it's finding allies."

MMORPG. 100-200 players on a single server. The playable world scaled accordingly.

Website: primevalor.net / raccoonbox.com/primevalor

**Goal:** To create a fully original MMORPG that gives developers the possibility to expose their identity and call the product their own. No legal gray areas. No hiding. A game built from the ground up to be legitimate, community-driven, and truly ours. I set this goal because Primevalor will be heavily inspired by World of Warcraft. And, my original idea was to use AzerothCore and WotLK client, but that has legal issues. My Primevalor will not have legal issues. It will be a freely made game. Original art.

## Technical Foundation

**Engine:** Godot 4.x for both client and server
- Open source, community-driven
- Perfect for 100-200 player servers
- Lightweight, fast iteration
- Headless server mode for efficient hosting

**Art Style:** WoW-inspired stylized graphics (WotLK era aesthetic)
- NOT realistic Unreal Engine look
- Stylized, painterly, timeless
- All original assets (Blender workflow)

**Server Architecture:** Godot headless instances
- Custom networking protocol
- PostgreSQL/SQLite database
- Fully original—no emulated cores

**Why Godot over alternatives:**
- No revenue sharing after success
- Complete control and transparency
- Lower barrier to entry for contributors
- Proven capable for our scale

## Universe and Lore

Inspired by Forgotten Realms and World of Warcraft, but entirely original.

We follow the Hollywood philosophy: "Give me the same thing, but different."

**Examples:**
- Network of tunnels under main zones (our "Underdark") → **Terraden**
- You won't see Stormwind, Deadmines, or Barrens
- You'll see zones that feel *familiar* but are distinctly **Primevalor**
- Recognizable inspiration, but never plagiarism

Primevalor is not another WoW private server. This is an original world with its own identity.

## Core Philosophy & Objectives

### 1. **Forced Social Interaction**
You will have to find a partner to complete 60% of PVE content.

You will never reach end-game without creating relationships, experiencing partnerships, meeting friends, and learning to trust someone.

Think of raiding like humans hunting mammoths—a communal activity that defines us. Legendary items (inspired by Atiesh, Thunderfury, Hand of Sulfuras) are created BY the community FOR a player. 

**Goal:** Make us feel less lonely. Make us feel attached to the community.

### 2. **Moral Alignment System**
Players choose playstyles that lead them to become villains OR paragons of virtue.

**Evil path:** Join dark factions, criminal enterprises, corrupt guilds, mafia  
**Good path:** Become a paladin of the people, earn worship, have your portrait in cathedral windows

Your choices shape your identity and how the world responds to you.

### 3. **Player-Driven Economy & PvP**
Rewards from professions and PvP are MORE valuable than boss loot.

Resources gathered from dungeons, mines, forests, deserts, and Terraden fuel player-crafted items that give advantages in PvP.

**Primevalor players are measured against players.**

The best player is simply better than anyone else. Like tennis legend Roger Federer—unbeatable against humans, not just hitting balls against a wall.

PvP follows universal rules of sport: skill, strategy, competition.

### 4. **Freedom to Be Human (Light and Dark)**
Players can practice controversial in-game services:
- Cartel management
- Escorting and prostitution
- Gambling
- Black market trading
- Thievery

But you can also be the image of righteousness:
- Police or bounty hunter
- Priest (with your own religion and church)
- Mayor of a town
- Charity leader
- Artist, musician, performer

**My goal:** Give us the possibility to explore those clean and dirty desires our flesh wants, so in everyday life we can have balanced minds with family, friends, and co-workers.

### 5. **Advanced AI**
Integrate AI tools for mobs to make their responses and actions unpredictable. The world feels alive.

### 6. **Controlled Economy**
Limited in-game cryptocurrency to prevent inflation and maintain market balance.

### 7. **Fun & Dopamine**
Above all: Have fun while playing Primevalor!

## About Me

I'm **Konstantin Nikkari**, a man approaching forty.

I have problems I've solved and gained experience from. More problems will face me today, tomorrow, and later. I'm made of flesh and bones. I have dreams and fears. Sometimes I fart. Quite often, actually. So nothing special there.

**Professional background:**
- Business management (11 years)
- Studies in design, security, acting, writing, mythologies, art, media, and video production
- Currently pursuing Master's Thesis in Human Enhancement design (Estimate completion spring 2026) and general interest in psychology and sociology.

**Psychology matters for Primevalor:**  
I will research basic human needs and how to implement them in-game:
- Rest, excitement, compassion, sex, attention, comfort
- Violence, power, money, greed

Understanding what drives us helps create meaningful gameplay.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Prototype (Current - Next 3 Months)
**My role:** Build a playable demo that proves the vision

**What I'm learning:**
- GDScript (building as I learn)
- Godot 4.x multiplayer systems
- Basic 3D game development

**What the prototype will show:**
- Stylized 3D world (WoW-inspired aesthetic)
- Character movement and controls
- 2-3 players connecting and seeing each other
- ONE unique Primevalor feature (likely moral alignment system)

**What the prototype WON'T have yet:**
- Complex server architecture (that's the engineer's job)
- Full game systems (that comes later)
- Polished assets (proof of concept first)

### Phase 2: Team Formation (After Prototype)
**Recruiting TWO core partners:**

1. **Engineer** (Server & Client)
   - Technically capable programmer
   - Handles complex networking, database, optimization
   - Rebuilds prototype architecture properly

2. **Marketing Specialist**
   - Understands marketing and monetization
   - Community building
   - Business strategy

**Together:** A team of weird, nerd, and mingy. Ha!

### Phase 3: Production (Team-Led Development)
- Engineer handles technical systems
- I handle game design, content, vision, team coordination
- Marketing person prepares for launch

## Current Status

**What exists now:**
- This vision document
- Basic Godot experimentation
- Lots of ambition

**What I'm working on:**
- Building the prototype foundation
- Learning GDScript through doing
- Creating basic playable demo to attract technical partners

**Honest assessment:**
I don't have deep programming knowledge yet. I have basic HTML/CSS understanding. But I have high creativity, excellent problem-solving skills, and I'm eager to lead people toward this vision.

The prototype I build won't be production-ready. That's okay. Its job is to prove the vision is worth building properly.

## Join Primevalor

I invite you to:
- Apply for engineer or marketing positions
- Contribute ideas and feedback
- Simply stick around and watch this journey unfold

This is going to be one hell of a ride for a man learning to code while building an MMORPG.

**How about that? Sounds like a hobby for the rest of my life.**

How many of you think I will fail miserably?

(I'm betting on success. Join me and prove the doubters wrong.)
